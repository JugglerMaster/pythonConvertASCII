# pythonConvertASCII
Converts binary stl files to ASCII

I created this so that I can use stl files with pycam, a dead project yes but hey, it works.

When I say created, I do mean that losely. I just copied another user's script and updated it to python 3 and made it write the converted stl to file. 

I found this script here: https://sourceforge.net/p/pycam/discussion/860184/thread/414c02d8/?limit=25#e67a
